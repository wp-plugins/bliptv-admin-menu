== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this download the actual video files from Blip.tv? =

No.  This will only download the data for each video and store that data in a table in your wordpress database.

= Why don't my uploads succeed? =

Uploading of your video files to your hosting server may not work for a couple reasons.
A few things to check are:
* Does your hosting provider allow file uploads?
* Your hosting provider's max upload file size limit: (upload_max_filesize) in php.ini.
* Your hosting provider's max post size limit: (post_max_size) in php.ini.
